# ðŸ”Œ Smart Home Automation App â€“ Jetpack Compose (Frontend UI)

This mobile application is a **frontend-only prototype** of a smart home automation system, developed using **Jetpack Compose in Android Studio**. It is designed for **1BHK, 2BHK, and 3BHK** home layouts and simulates the control of smart devices through a modern, neon-themed UI.

# App Overview

The app provides interactive UI layouts for:
- **1BHK**
